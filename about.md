**Nova Patch** (they/them), Dublin, Ireland.

I work at the intersection of language, technology, and culture.

My background is in software engineering and product development. I’m interested in how global systems are built: how internationalization, character encoding, typography, search, and metadata shape everyday experience across languages.

That work has touched more than 30 languages, through product localization, open source development, and contributions to open standards. I’m a lifetime individual member of the Unicode Consortium and care about durable digital infrastructure and inclusive design.

I’m also drawn to systems of observation and taxonomy in natural history, particularly in the study of lichens and urban ecosystems. The same questions return there: how we name things, how we classify them, and what follows from those decisions.

This site is a digital garden for ongoing work. Notes and observations accumulate slowly.
