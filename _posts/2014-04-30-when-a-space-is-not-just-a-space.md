[Shutterstock Tech Blog](https://tech.shutterstock.com/) featured an interview with me by [Dan McCormick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccormickdaniel) titled [*When a Space Is Not Just a Space*](https://web.archive.org/web/20170810105202/https://tech.shutterstock.com/2014/04/30/when-a-space-is-not-just-a-space/). We discussed the interesting complexities of Unicode whitespace and how to parse it using regular expressions, with examples in Java and Perl.
